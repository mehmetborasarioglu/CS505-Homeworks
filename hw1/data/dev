Nope. He just got it because he could
I don't know. He said soup but I didn't really see soup stuff

It's fine xP
Aww lol
Lol
Ikea's open late, huh?
Hey love.. sorry I crashed =(
Thanks love.. I think I left my wallet at home. If not, it's fucking gone
Oookay, reintroduced myself to Mithun lol
Btw, can't have lunch, I may have lost my wallet and need to go home lol
Do you want to go to that?
Fuuuuck. Have you seen a wallet around?
Oh man I'm screwed =(
Not much cash, but my state id, cal card, military id, and debit card =/
Yeah, definitely. I'm also gonna check that auditorium
I think I lost my wallet =/ shit =/ the worst thing is, it's achecking habit that I've been forcing myself to quash and if I hadn'tI'd have it =/
Fuck I literally don't know what to do. If I don't find it I willhave no more than five bucks for a month because there's no accessiblewf
Did Mark switch classes?
Is he going?
Alright, thanks love.. this sucks
=/ I just want my ids... and if course this is the one time I have cash -.-
Alright.. <name> said he'd loan me money if I need it till then =)Fuck I can't even see walking in the rain, no joke
Yup.. two min if walking and I gave up avoiding puddles
Yeah xP debit will be here in  <#> , the other guy rushed my creditfor  <#>  which is fine =D
Yeah.. so uh how will I fly without id?
Nope. I have a umich id and a birth certificate.. I have my soc cardand temp licence paper too I guess
Alright =/ fuck fuck fuck
Ohhhh snap
This just sucks so much. You know the fucked up part? If I just letmyself have my compulsions, I would've been checking for it

Something wrong? We can call if you want love
Oh it's fine lol
Mmhm =)
Playing my gihtar

ILYMTYLMNR! Just wonderin' if you have any planideas about hangingout... also that imperial march was pretty great
Dayum you gon get all da bitches
Hahahhahaha
I bet you're excited xP
Well to be fair I'm sure it'll be more reliable at least xP
Yeah haha.. Btw I'm crazy drowsy.. we can call if you want and if Istop responding wake my ass up
XP
Alright, you?
Justin?
That's not so strange lol. Just because you're unnecessarily hostiletowards any notion of religion.. =P
Iiii dunno. User your best judgement, we've been together for the years =P
Tshirt stage?
People are religious. They have beliefs. And not just because theywere forced to -.-
That's as bad as psycho religious people lol
Ohhhh
You're the atheist equivalent of the Christian who screams thatyou'll go to hell if you read Harry Potter
Lol
I'm sure they think they're not like that too lol
Sorry, I just don't understand why you hate it so much
Okay, look down on it so much
In general I guess so, but if I knew one not like that - and I knowtons of great English majors - I'd see exceptions. You know Justinisn't just retarded
I wouldn't if she'd proven herself to be a cool person.. instead shesaid she was going to knock on each door to find me the first nighthere
Yeah, admittedly that was weird... but that could be just as muchpart of him being 'conservative'. Religious people aren't known forbeing against immigrant rights as far as I've seen lol
Soo
Wait what?
I guess... I just can't see it as a negative thing myself and don'tnecessarily find it even that illogical... if anything, it's a topicyou could literally never have an actual answer for
Because religion isn't just that
Plenty of religious people don't believe in bullshit creation mythsor impossible floods by god or whatever... they just believe an entityexists
No it's not. Religious people denying certain scientific facts likeevolution or the big bang or something are dumb and illogical and Ican't respect that either, but religion in conjunction with sense isfine... People like Justin likely don't think they're literallyreading Christ's flesh, and I'm not arguing for every religious personout there... lots ARE batshit insane,  like my grandma "healing mewith the power of Jesus", trust me I'm not defending that
The thing is, people believe in organised religion without buyinginto every aspect of it... plus, lots of churches and things are verychill
I've gone to a lot of churches before for a lot of religions. Someare fucking nuts, others are just people who believe in an entity andalso known facts
At Unitarian churches you get lots of people from different religionswho just want a good community and chance to believe what they want,not really all that dumb I don't think... they're normal people whoagree with intellectual truths and happen to think "oh somethinggodlike is out there"
I don't think you do
I just don't understand why it's incompatible with reasonable thoughtif you take science over religion while still holding religiousbeliefs
Saying Earth is 6k years old or that woman came from a rib orwhatever is ridiculous... the actual entity isn't in my opinion. Ifscience could prove  within reason that a kind if god  didn't exist,it'd be ridiculous to believe in
I see a problem with believing in things counter to evidence we have,but not things without evidence
Saying creationism is real is nuts, because we can reasonably price that it is
Prove
Because it doesn't serve any purpose I guess... I don't know,religion is half to understand what you can't, primarily death. Thereis no other purpose for the unicorns and any other explanation oftotally unknown stuff could be just as wrong
Oh I know, don't get me wrong, it's not like I'm sitting herethinking you're just a terrible person who hates him or that I'm onsome elevated plane of whatever lol... I just can tell you what weirdthings you do and get an explanation, whereas, say, Hemisha wouldscoff and berate you if you tried to have a similar conversation lol
And I conceded to whatever you say about Noah's Ark kind of people =P
Wtf really?
Getting the real frat experience I see
Nice!!!
Hahahah I thought you meant the people outside
Hahaha
En.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTD
won't you feel dumb when the storm returns and you hear screams =P

Sho
Btw, SLUgS eventually? When should we plan to plan?
I agree
Uggghhhh
Please don't use your frustration with Savannah as a reason to get mad at me
I was sitting there saying that I had some idea of might might workand you kept offering advice I didn't ask for.. I've dealt with thisall day and didn't want to talk about it anymore.. you're the I've whoasked if I found it
Sorry but I've been running around all day and am sick of dealingwith wallet shit and your advice wasn't going to change anything
Then don't talk to me about things you just want sympathy on. Ever.
I wasn't even talking about it to talk about it. I said I ess tiredfrom running around and you started asking about it
Yooo
