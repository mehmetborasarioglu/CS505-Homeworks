        # algorithm is that when we are at a "target cell" (i.e. a cell to update) in our chart, we will search
        # through a combination of cell pairs. Given a cell pair c_ik, and c_kj, both of which contain a collection
        # of nonterminals, we will search for any rule in our grammar X -> A B where A \in c_ik, and B \in c_kj. If
        # such a rule exists, we will add nonterminal X to the "target cell".

        # Whether we're doing the vanilla cky algorithm or cky_viterbi, the cell traversal structure is the same.
        # So this method will solely be responsible for doing the traversal. Once your code has determined
        # the coordinates of the "target cell" and a cell pair, you should call the update_func_ptr with these
        # cell coordinates.

        # The purpose of the update_func_ptr is to abstract the traversal away from actually updating your
        # dynamic programming structures. In vanilla cky, this is updating a chart. In cky_viterbi, this is
        # updating multiple charts (one for the backpointers and another for the logprobs...you can combine these
        # into a single chart if you want). Either way, the updating functionality is only possible once you know
        # the coordinates. So we can abstract away vanilla cky and cky_viterbi into a cky_traversal on a specific
        # chart(s) updating scheme. The function pointer here is where you will update your chart(s) and only needs
        # to be called from here.
